 * @section DESCRIPTION
 * Target-specific runtime functions for the C target language.
 * This API layer can be used in conjunction with:
 *     target C;
 * 
 * Note for target language developers. This is one way of developing a target language where 
 * the C core runtime is adopted. This file is a translation layer that implements Lingua Franca 
 * APIs which interact with the internal _lf_SET and _lf_schedule APIs. This file can act as a 
 * template for future runtime developement for target languages.
 * For source generation, see xtext/org.icyphy.linguafranca/src/org/icyphy/generator/CCppGenerator.xtend.
